# crosvm-bootstrap

A collection of scripts and dockerfiles to generate Docker images meant to host
[crosvm](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/crosvm/).

Edit files in `default-config/` to change the default settings for the images 
generated by the container. Override the config by mounting a volume on
`app/config` in the container with your modified config files.

Run the `build-*.sh` scripts to generate your Docker containers.
