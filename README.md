# crosvm-bootstrap

A collection of scripts and dockerfiles to generate Docker images meant to host
[crosvm](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/crosvm/).

## Quickstart
1. Run ./tools/install_system_dependencies.sh to install all system dependencies.
2. Run ./sync_code.sh to fetch the code.
3. Run `./build.sh --rebuild-all` to kick off the build of the container and generate
a rootfs image using the default settings.
4. Run ./launcher.sh $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR $WAYLAND_DISPLAY $DISPLAY to launch the vm.
5. Once inside VM, call setup-containers.sh everytime you re-build containers.
6. Inside VM: Call launch.sh will start the container.
7. Once inside container you can run demo application using launch i.e. es2gears_wayland. For X11: launch-x es2gears_wayland


## How to customize
Edit files in `default-config/` to change the default settings for the images 
generated by the container. Override the config in an existing container image 
by mounting a the your `default-config/` with your modified config files on
`/app/config` in the container.

For more information about how to utilize the container, refer to the
[Dockerfile README](dockerfiles/README.md)
